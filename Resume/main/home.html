      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p class="welcome-message">Thank you again for your time. My name is Sommy Yang. Hope you enjoy learning a little more about me!</p>
      <p>I'm a passionate Tech Advocate with over 10 years of experience supporting others in tech. I love helping people solve problems, making technology simpler to understand, and staying resourceful with the ever-growing landscape of new and emerging technologies.</p>
      <p>I believe in being a generalist—knowing 80% of many areas rather than 100% of one. To some, 80% isn't good enough, but this approach allows me to connect the dots across technologies, adapt quickly to new challenges, and provide well-rounded solutions. I thrive in fast-paced environments, excel at team-building, and am committed to continuous learning and growth.</p>
      <p>This interactive portfolio gives you a deeper look into my professional journey, technical expertise, education, and what I enjoy outside of tech.</p>
