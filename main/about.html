      <h2>About Me - The Tech Side</h2>
      <p>With over 10 years in tech, I've worn many hats—technical support, web security, cloud infrastructure, and automation. What drives me? Solving complex problems while keeping customer success at the center of everything I do.</p>
      <p>My toolkit includes web security (malware remediation, XSS/SQLi patching), cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), security tech (WAF, IAM, SSO/SAML, OAuth), monitoring tools (DataDog, ElasticSearch, CloudWatch, Grafana), and automation with Python, Bash, Java, and Perl. But more than the tech itself, I love building solutions that scale, mentoring teams, and creating documentation that actually helps people.</p>
      <p>Here's my philosophy: Tech shouldn't be hard. I make it simple by relating it to everyday life. Whether you're brand new to tech or leveling up your skills, I'm here to break down the complex stuff and learn alongside you. Everyone deserves to feel confident with technology.</p>

      <h2>About Me - Outside of Work</h2>
      <p>Beyond the code, I'm a husband, father, and son. Family is my foundation—they keep me grounded and remind me what really matters.</p>
      <p>I'm a first-generation Hmong American, born in California and raised in Minnesota. My story is the immigrant experience: bridging two cultures, honoring where I came from, and building something better for the next generation. This journey has shaped how I approach problems, taught me resilience, and shown me the power of community.</p>
      <p>Navigating two worlds has been a privilege. It's taught me the value of hard work, adaptability, and staying true to your roots. These same values show up in how I work with technology and help others succeed.</p>
