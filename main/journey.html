      <h2>My Tech Journey</h2>
      <p>It all started in 2014 at Lake Superior College, where I got my hands dirty with hardware and software support. Diagnosing issues, managing inventory, working with databases—this is where I fell in love with figuring out how systems tick and solving problems efficiently.</p>
      <p>From 2014 to 2017 at HCL Technologies, I leveled up in enterprise support. I became the go-to person for Learning Management System integrations, mentored teams, and hit a 90% customer satisfaction rate. This is where I learned that clear communication and solid documentation are just as important as technical skills.</p>
      <p>My career took me through some amazing places: Arvig (network diagnostics and fiber support), Amazon Robotics (building automation tools and monitoring machine health), and Vercel (modern cloud platforms and AI-driven support). At Amazon, I built Python, Java, and Perl tools that caught problems before they hit production. At Vercel, I helped pioneer AI-powered self-service solutions and led incident management.</p>
      <p>Since 2019, I've been at Calabrio as a Technical Lead, serving as the Product SME for Service Delivery. I lead escalations, build automation tools, and run training sessions for AWS and Azure deployments. Recently, I jumped into web security at Sectigo—malware remediation, vulnerability patching, and managing vendor relationships with Certificate and CDN providers.</p>
      <p>Here's what I've learned: The best tech solutions come from understanding both the technology AND the people using it. Whether it's writing docs that actually help, mentoring teammates, or explaining complex stuff in simple terms—it's all about the human connection.</p>
