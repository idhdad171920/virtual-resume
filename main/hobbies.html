      <h2>Outside of Tech</h2>
      
      <p>When I'm not solving technical challenges or writing code, I enjoy exploring interests that help me maintain balance and bring fresh perspectives to my work.</p>

        <h3>🍜 Foodie at Heart</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">I love to try new foods wherever they present themselves - whether that's a new eatery, a menu item at the local restaurant, or a vendor at the fair. I'm always down to enhance my palate and discover new flavors. Food is more than sustenance; it's an adventure and a way to experience different cultures.</p>

        <h3>🎣 Outdoorsman</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">Fishing, hunting, and gardening have always been passions of mine, rooted in my traditional immigrant family upbringing. There's something grounding about being outdoors, connecting with nature, and carrying on traditions passed down through generations. Whether I'm casting a line, tending to the garden, or out in the field, these activities keep me connected to my roots.</p>

        <h3>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Time</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">Above all, I love to hang out with family and friends as often as I can. Watching my kids grow up and learn new things brings me immense joy.
