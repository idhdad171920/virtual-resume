      <h2>How This Website Was Made</h2>
      
      <p>Ever wonder what goes into building a website? Let me break it down for you in simple terms so you can build something like this to impress yourself and others!</p>
      
      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>🏗️ HTML (The Building Blocks)</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">Think of HTML like the skeleton and structure of a house. It tells the browser "put a heading here, a paragraph there, and a button over here." Every page you see (Home, About, Experience, etc.) is built with HTML. It's like writing instructions: "This is a title. This is some text. This is a link to another page."</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>🎨 CSS (The Paint and Decorations)</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">CSS is like painting and decorating that house. It makes things look pretty! It decides the colors, fonts, spacing, and how things move when you hover over them. That cool blue color you see? That's CSS. The cards that pop out when you hover? Also CSS. It's what makes the website look professional instead of just plain black text on a white background.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>✨ JavaScript (The Magic Tricks)</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">JavaScript makes the website interactive and fun! Remember how the welcome message types itself out? Or how the navigation cards slide in one by one? That's JavaScript doing its magic. It's like having a little helper that says "when someone scrolls down, make this appear" or "when they click here, do this cool animation." It brings the website to life!</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>📱 Responsive Design (Works Everywhere)</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">This website looks good whether you're on a phone, tablet, or computer. That's called "responsive design." It's like having clothes that automatically adjust to fit you perfectly no matter your size. The website rearranges itself to look great on any screen. On a phone, things stack vertically. On a big computer screen, they spread out nicely.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>🎯 Custom Properties (Smart Shortcuts)</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">I used CSS custom properties (also called variables) to keep everything consistent. Imagine if you had to paint every wall in your house individually versus having one paint bucket you use everywhere. If you want to change the color, you just change the bucket! That's what custom properties do - they let me define colors, spacing, and fonts once, then use them everywhere.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>🎬 Animations and Transitions</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">All those smooth movements you see - cards sliding in, things fading, the hover effects - are carefully crafted animations. It's like choreographing a dance. Each element knows when to move, how fast to move, and where to go. This makes the website feel polished and professional instead of jumpy or boring.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>🤖 AI Assistant (Kiro)</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">I used Kiro, an AI-powered code editor and assistant, to help build this website. Think of Kiro like having a really smart coding buddy who can write code, suggest improvements, and help solve problems. Instead of typing everything manually, I could describe what I wanted ("make the cards pop out on hover") and Kiro helped generate the code. It's like having a translator that turns my ideas into actual working code!</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>💻 Code Editor (Where the Magic Happens)</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">All the code was written in Kiro's built-in code editor. A code editor is like Microsoft Word, but for programmers. It helps you write code by color-coding different parts (so you can read it easier), catching mistakes, and organizing your files. Kiro's editor is special because it has AI built right in, so it can help you write better code faster.</p>

      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>📁 File Structure (Keeping Things Organized)</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">The website is organized into folders, just like organizing files on your computer. There's a folder for styles (CSS files), a folder for scripts (JavaScript files), and separate HTML files for each page. This keeps everything neat and easy to find. It's like having a filing cabinet where you know exactly where everything is.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>🎨 Design Principles</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">The website follows modern design principles: clean layout, consistent colors (that professional blue you see everywhere), good spacing so things aren't cramped, and clear navigation so you always know where you are. It's designed to be easy on the eyes and easy to use. Good design is invisible - you don't notice it, you just enjoy using the website.</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>⚡ Performance (Fast and Smooth)</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">The website is built to load quickly and run smoothly. There are no heavy images or unnecessary code slowing things down. Every animation is optimized to be smooth. It's like having a sports car that's been tuned perfectly - it just works beautifully without any lag or stuttering.</p>

      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>🌐 GitHub & GitHub Pages (Sharing with the World)</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">This website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which is like a free home for your website on the internet. GitHub is where developers store and share their code - think of it as Google Drive, but specifically for code. GitHub Pages takes your code and turns it into a live website that anyone can visit. It's completely free and automatically updates whenever you make changes to your code!</p>
        <p class="experience-description">The source code for this entire website is publicly available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/idhdad171920/virtual-resume" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com/idhdad171920/virtual-resume</a>. This means you can see exactly how everything works, learn from it, or even use it as a starting point for your own website. That's the beauty of open source - we all learn from each other!</p>
      </article>
      
      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>🚀 Version Control with Git</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">Git is like a time machine for your code. Every time I make changes to the website, Git saves a snapshot. If something breaks, I can go back to when it was working. It also lets me try new features without worrying about messing up the main website. Think of it like having unlimited "undo" buttons and the ability to work on multiple versions at once. Every professional developer uses Git - it's an essential tool!</p>

      <article class="experience-entry">
        <h3>🎓 The Bottom Line</h3>
        <p class="experience-description">Building a website is like building a house: you need a strong structure (HTML), beautiful decorations (CSS), and some cool features that make it special (JavaScript). With the help of AI tools like Kiro, anyone can learn to build websites. You don't need to be a genius - you just need curiosity and the willingness to learn!</p>
        <p class="experience-description"><strong>Want to learn more?</strong> The best way to understand how websites work is to try building one yourself. Start small, experiment, and don't be afraid to break things - that's how we all learn! Check out the source code on GitHub to see exactly how this website was built.</p>
